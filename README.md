Image Processing & Computer Vision Projects
This repository features a set of practical computer vision projects built using classical image processing techniques in Python. The projects utilize OpenCV, NumPy, and other essential libraries for image analysis and processing.

Achievements:

* Secured 3rd place in a team-based competition.

Technologies & Tools:

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, pytesseract
* Raspberry Pi (for hardware-oriented projects)
* Linux (development environment)

Selected Projects:

* Line Detection:

  * Identifies lines and their angles in images using edge detection and Hough Transform.

* Bubble Detection:

  * Detects bubbles in images with thresholding and preprocessing techniques.

* Color and Shape Recognition:

  * Detects objects based on color and geometric shapes, including circles, squares, and triangles.

* Object Counting:

  * Counts objects in images or video frames using background subtraction and contour analysis.
  * Preprocessing involves Gaussian, Bilateral filtering, and adaptive thresholding.

* Distance Measurement:

  * Calculates distances between objects with pixel-to-real-world mapping and calibration.

* Arrow Detection:

  * Detects arrows and determines their direction through shape and contour analysis.

* Object Tracking:

  * Tracks moving objects across video frames using centroid tracking and bounding boxes.
